The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8

Sample input and Output 2:
Enter the number of Months :
12
The amoeba size is 89


PROGRAM::
#python
print("Enter the number of Months :")
n=int(input())
f1=0
f2=1
temp=f1
count=0
if (n<0):
    print("enter a positive number")
elif (n==1):
    print("0")
else:
    while (count<n-1):
        temp=f1+f2
        f1=f2
        f2=temp
        count=count+1
print("The amoeba size is {}".format(f1))
